This is a glorified meetup.com proxy.

Once you have cloned this, use meetup.cfg.sample as a template.

Modify meetup.cfg.sample to use your API key. Do not addit to your repo.

Update settings.py to point to your meetup.cfg

TODO:

* Add a cache layer to both improve performance as well as compensate
for temporary outages of connectivity to meetup.com.

* The look and feel is not remotely done or as nice as it could be.

* Pagination where needed

* Components of pinax (http://pinaxproject.com/) might be nice to
  integrate in.
